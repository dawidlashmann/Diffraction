# Diffraction
Physics simulation

Numerical simulation, exposing wave-particle nature of light.

The programm, calculates, how light would be distributed on a wall, let through a diffraction grating

In this project, I used the `Simphson's rule` to approximate the integral of light distrubution.

The code creates the `wave.data` and `diff_grating.data` files, that contain data to be plotted.

Below is an example of that data, visualised in Gnuplot
